## Hi there üëã 

üè¢ I help organizations manage open source in a strategic, safe and efficient manner that meets their business needs. Or as I like to put it "How can we do open source
at scale and speed whilst staying safe, respect licenses, enable upstream sustainability, and make life easier for our devs?"

I have been working on answering the above question as an open source project maintainer/contributor of various [projects](#projects) and by sharing my [experiences](#talks) trying to help the open source commmunity move forward.

ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open source supply chain (security), [SBOM](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom), and managing open source in organizations. Open to speaking opportunities.

üí¨ Ask me anything open source, dealing with toddlers or about my two cats üò∫

### Projects 

I'm regularly contributing to...

#### <a href="https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort">OSS Review Toolkit</a>

OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) provides tooling to safely use, integrate, modify and redistribute third party software including [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). 

You can use it to:
- Generate [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) or [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) SBOMs for your software project
- Automate your FOSS policy using _Policy as Code_ to do licensing, security vulnerabilities and engineering standards checks for your software project and its dependencies
- Correct found invalid or missing package metadata (licensing, source location, etc.)
- Overwrite scanner license findings in the sources of your software project and its dependencies
- Mark files, directories or or package manager scopes as not included in your software project or dependency released artifacts - use it to make clear that license findings in build scripts, documentation or tests in a package sources do not apply to the release (binary) artifact
- Create a source code archive for your software project, including its dependencies to comply with certain licenses or have your own copy as nothing on the internet is forever

I'm one of the project's maintainers and a frequent speaker at conferences as the project's spokesperson.

#### <a href="https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec">SPDX</a>

Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) is an open standard for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). SPDX allows the expression of components, licenses, copyrights, security references and other metadata relating to software. I'm currently the [lead](https://spdx.dev/engage/participate/technical-team/) for [Security Profile specfication](https://lists.spdx.org/g/spdx-defects) working to exchange quality, vulnerability, and software supportability information in SPDX.
